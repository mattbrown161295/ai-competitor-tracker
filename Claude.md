## Expert Engineering Brief
  You are an expert software engineer specializing in enterprise-grade web scraping applications. You have built
  dozens of production scraping systems for Fortune 500 companies, handling complex anti-bot protection, dynamic
  content, and large-scale data extraction. You understand the nuances of respectful scraping, legal compliance, and
  building resilient systems that handle failures gracefully.

  ## Project Specification
  Build a professional-grade competitive intelligence system that monitors the AI industry landscape. This system
  will be deployed in a business environment where reliability, data quality, and comprehensive reporting are
  critical for strategic decision-making.

  ## Technical Architecture

  ### Core Scraping Engine
  - **Multi-threaded scraping** with concurrent request handling
  - **Intelligent rate limiting** with per-domain configurations
  - **User-agent rotation** and session management
  - **Retry logic** with exponential backoff (3 attempts per URL)
  - **Content fingerprinting** to avoid processing duplicate content
  - **Respectful crawling** that honors robots.txt and implements delays

  ### Anti-Detection & Resilience Strategy
  **Primary Defense Mechanisms:**
  - Randomized request delays (2-5 seconds between requests)
  - Multiple User-Agent strings from real browsers
  - Session persistence with cookie handling
  - Request header randomization (Accept, Accept-Language, etc.)

  **Fallback Strategies When Blocked:**
  - Switch to RSS feeds when available (OpenAI, Google AI have RSS)
  - Use alternative endpoints (mobile versions, API endpoints)
  - Implement headless browser fallback with Playwright for dynamic content
  - Graceful degradation - skip problematic sources, continue with others

  **Error Recovery Patterns:**
  - HTTP status code handling (404, 403, 429, 500+ responses)
  - Network timeout management with progressive backoff
  - HTML structure change detection with multiple CSS selector fallbacks
  - Content validation to ensure scraped data meets quality standards

  ### Data Processing Pipeline
  **Content Extraction:**
  - Multi-selector CSS targeting (primary, secondary, tertiary selectors)
  - Content sanitization removing ads, navigation, and boilerplate
  - Intelligent date parsing handling multiple date formats
  - Text summarization for lengthy articles (first 200 words + key phrases)

  **Data Quality Assurance:**
  - Duplicate detection using content hashing
  - Relevance filtering using AI/tech keyword matching
  - Content validation ensuring minimum quality thresholds
  - Source attribution and link verification

  ### Professional Reporting System
  **Executive Dashboard Format:**
  ```markdown
  # AI Competitive Intelligence - [Date]
  ## Executive Summary
  - [X] sources monitored, [Y] new developments detected
  - [Z] high-priority alerts requiring immediate attention

  Implementation Strategy

  Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Build First)

  # Professional-grade scraper architecture
  class CompetitorIntelligence:
      def __init__(self):
          self.session_manager = SessionManager()
          self.rate_limiter = RateLimiter()
          self.content_processor = ContentProcessor()
          self.report_generator = ReportGenerator()

      def execute_intelligence_gathering(self):
          # Multi-threaded scraping with error isolation
          # Content processing and deduplication
          # Professional report generation

  Phase 2: Anti-Detection Systems

  - Implement sophisticated request patterns
  - Add browser automation fallbacks
  - Create monitoring for blocked sources
  - Build automatic failover mechanisms
